   * __Easily select their organisation unit__ - This invokes the List Hierarchy Nodes Conquest API to generate a nested organisation tree structure for quick traversal and selection by the user.

   * __Attach image to request__ - The user gets the option to attach image to the newly created request. This invokes the Add Document Conquest API to create a new document record and upload an image to the newly created request.
